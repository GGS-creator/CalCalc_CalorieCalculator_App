# CalCalc_CalorieCalculator_App
Calcalc is an app created by me to count the number of calories consumed by a user. The user can enter the number of calories for each food item and just click to cheak how much calories the user has consumed. There are default food items built in the app with the average calories for each food item. The app also has the calorie convertor which tells the user how many steps the user has to walk to burn calories. And it has a step to calorie convertor which tells the number of calories burnt using the number of steps walked. The app also has a mini game and a discription about the app.  :)
